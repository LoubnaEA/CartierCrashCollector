# Data & QA Automation Project

## From Crash : Exploring Data, Testing and Agile Organization


### Project Overview
This repository hosts a **fictional yet functional** learning and demo project centered on the iconic **Cartier Crash watch**.  
The goal is to showcase practical skills in **QA testing (manual and automated)**, **data analysis** and **Agile-inspired project organization**.


### Project Scope & Intent
Initially, this project focuses on one watch model.
However, the **long-term vision** is to expand its scope to cover : multiple watch models from Cartier, other luxury watch brands, potentially other luxury collectible categories.

Future Possibilities : extending support to multiple models and brands, eveloping a backend API and data pipelines, creating an interactive web app for collectors and investors, implementing CI/CD pipelines and advanced test automation

This repository acts as a **proof of concept and personal sandbox** to explore QA & Data workflows, test automation frameworks and project management best practices.


### Tech Stack
- QA Automation : Selenium, Robot Framework, Pytest, Postman
- Data Analysis : Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL
- Agile-inspired project management : GitHub Projects (Kanban boards, backlog, sprints)
- Documentation : Markdown, GitHub Wiki

### Current Status
- The project is **currently theoretical**, designed for demonstration and learning.
- Agile workflow and backlog are **simulated solo** for organization purposes.
- Test scripts and datasets are functional but limited in scope.
- The architecture allows future real-world expansion.


### Agile Workflow (Simulated)
This project uses GitHub Projects for issue tracking and sprint management.

The board contains:
- Backlog : Features and tasks to be done
- In Progress : Current development items
- Done : Completed features and fixes
