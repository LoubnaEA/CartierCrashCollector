# Data & QA Automation Project

---

## From Crash : Exploring Data, Testing and Agile Organization

### Overview
**Fictional yet functional** learning and demo project centered on the iconic **Cartier Crash watch**.  
The goal is to showcase practical skills in **QA testing**, **data analysis** and **Agile-inspired project organization**.

### Scope & Intent
Initially, this project focuses on one watch model.
However, the **long-term vision** is to expand its scope to cover : multiple watch models from Cartier, other luxury watch brands, potentially other luxury collectible categories.

Future Possibilities : extending support to multiple models and brands, eveloping a backend API and data pipelines, creating an interactive web app for collectors and investors, implementing CI/CD pipelines and advanced test automation

### Tech Stack
- QA Automation : Selenium, Robot Framework, Pytest, Postman
- Data Analysis : Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL
- Agile-inspired project management : GitHub Projects (Kanban boards, backlog, sprints)
- Documentation : Markdown, GitHub Wiki

### Structure
 📁 src/           → Application source code (placeholder)  
 📁 tests/         → Automated and manual test cases  
 📁 data/          → Sample datasets and mocks  
 📁 docs/          → Documentation, test plans, Agile user stories
 
### Current Status
- The project is **currently theoretical**, designed for demonstration and learning
- Agile workflow and backlog are **simulated solo** for organization purposes
- Test scripts and datasets are functional but limited in scope
- The architecture allows future real-world expansion

### Agile Workflow (Simulated)
This project uses GitHub Projects for issue tracking and sprint management.  

The board contains :  
- Backlog : Features and tasks to be done  
- In Progress : Current development items  
- Done : Completed features and fixes  

### Disclaimer
This project is not affiliated with Cartier or any watchmaker.   
All data and concepts are for educational and demonstration purposes only.
